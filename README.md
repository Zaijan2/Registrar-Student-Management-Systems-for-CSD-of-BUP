#Student Enrollment Management Systems (SEMS) For Computer Studies Department of Bicol University Polangui


Our group proposes the development of a Student Enrollment Management System (SEMS) designed to streamline and digitalize the enrollment process. This system will enhance operational efficiency by automating student registration, course selection, and record management. By integrating a centralized database, it will minimize redundancies and improve data accuracy, ultimately benefiting students, faculty, and administrative personnel.
